    <p>Avalon is a social deduction game where players are divided into two teams: the loyal servants of Arthur and the minions of Mordred. The game consists of several rounds, each with a quest that the players must complete. However, the minions of Mordred are trying to sabotage the quests, while the loyal servants of Arthur aim to complete them successfully.</p>
    
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>The game begins with players being assigned roles secretly. The roles include Merlin, who knows the identities of the minions of Mordred but must be careful not to reveal himself, and the minions of Mordred, who are trying to conceal their identities while sabotaging the quests. The players then select a leader who will propose a team to go on the quest.</p>
    
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Each round consists of two phases: the team-building phase and the quest phase. During the team-building phase, the leader proposes a team to go on the quest, and the players vote on whether to approve the team. If the team is approved, they proceed to the quest phase, where they secretly vote on whether to succeed or fail the quest.</p>
    
    <h2>Endgame</h2>
    <p>The game ends when one team wins three quests (for a game with seven or more players) or five quests (for a game with less than seven players). The loyal servants of Arthur win if they successfully complete enough quests, while the minions of Mordred win if they sabotage enough quests.</p>
